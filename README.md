<p2>   #  Hi there, this is a mini-project for discrete math. </p2>

> Using C program randomly generate an undirected graph represented by adjacency matrix with n= 1000 vertices. (You may use rand function for this purpose).
> Determine number of edges in the graph. Determine the degree of all vertices ..... so on...
